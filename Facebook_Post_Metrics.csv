Economists’ Opinions about Economics” with Armin Falk, interviewing 10,000 economists on their perceptions of the discipline. 

By asking the opinions of a wide and international range of economists, they were able to understand how researchers want economics to evolve. Join us to discuss policy relevance, specialization, multidisciplinary, riskiness, disruptiveness, and quality of research and get a glimpse of what economics may look like in the future.

#Excerptionals: Investing in the Unseen: Cases on Biodiversity Conservation (Ateneo de Manila University Press, 2018) is a sourcebook on development management written by Benjamin C. Bagadion Jr. and edited by Violet B. Valdez. The book contains in-depth teaching cases that capture ground realities that illustrate the dilemmas of conservation along with the plight of protected area managers across different management modalities namely, local, national, and corporate settings.

The strategies and practices in the cases, both orthodox and unorthodox, can serve as a guide to effective management not only in environmental conservation, but in other fields as well.

Bagadion's book won Best Book in Science during the 38th National Book Awards in 2019.

Details about the event:
The success of 'independent' central banks in avoiding inflation is a crowning achievement of the macroeconomic policy consensus over the past four decades. Yet the swelling of balance sheets, the resurgence of inflationary pressures, and the looming threat of climate catastrophe all demand we interrogate the deeply political considerations that animate central bank policy. In particular, understanding the relationship between central banking and private finance is essential to examining these institutions' current operations and projecting directions for reform.
Dr. Benjamin Braun will be discussing his paper (summarised in this FT article) on the infrastructural power of CBs as it pertains to the resuscitation of market-based finance following the global financial crisis, highlighting the ways in which financial interests have shaped central banking policy. To quote at length from his article: ""Financial markets, especially repo and securitisation markets, have come to serve as the infrastructure for monetary policy. The result has been a problematic alignment between the interests of bankers and central bankers, whereby both sides have a preference for a deep and liquid markets for … everything, ideally""
Professor Daniela Gabor will then be speaking on how the politico-financial nexus may compromise a holistic approach to a green transition, examining the role of central banks in the fiscal monetary architecture of the 'Wall Street Consensus', whereby: "" development becomes a strategy of green financialization through which private finance manages the environmental crisis..."" To listen to Professor Gabor discuss these issues, we highly recommend her appearance on the Odd Lots podcast
Following speaker presentations, there will be ample time for questions from the audience, so do come prepared!
